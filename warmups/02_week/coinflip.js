// The Ultimate Life Decider
// Never make a decision again!

// Core problem
// Create a file called decider.js
// Write a function called coinFlip that will console.log HEADS or TAILS when called
// Add a counter that declares WINNER in the console when either HEADS or TAILS is flipped 5 times.
// Extension
// Create a file called decider.html
// Find any coin image online
// Link the .js file, while you're there you may also decide to add a .css file for some styling
// Now add the necessary components to the decider.html file so that when the coin image is clicked the coinFlip function result and tally are returned somewhere on the page.
