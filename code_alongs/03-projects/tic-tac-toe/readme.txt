Tic Tac Toe

Two main divs, side by side, each 50% width.  Left holds the board, right holds players, turn indicators and score.  When it's Player One's turn, recreate image of Ready Player One book cover, background and font.

Is each box clickable?  Yes, and class of 'clicked' is added.

Player One gets to pick either X or O.  Player Two goes first!

If Player One clicks a box, enter whatever they chose.  Player Two automatically gets the other.

Make sure you can't click an occupied box.
